# Arduino-network-status
IN PROGRESS project to give Arduino based platforms access to Prometheus API. This will in the end give them the possibility to act and monitor a networks status.

## Intention
The goal of this project is to eventually be able to use Arduino based platforms to trigger
physical events based on a networks status.

## TO DO
[ ] Figure out useful data structure for the data (structs, lists, maps, ...)  
[ ] Figure out how to transelate the HTTP JSON response into a useful data structure  
[ ] Invent and impelemt functions for the data structures (fetch(), update(), trigger(), ...)  
[ ] Research good physical triggers for netzork status (light, sound, ...)
## Disclaimer
This project is in it's baby shoes atm, so far from working.
